# How is the debt-to-income ratio calculated?

1. Add up all of your monthly debts. These payments may include: 

    Monthly mortgage or rent payment
    Minimum credit card payments
    Auto, student or personal loan payments
    Monthly alimony or child support payments
    Any other debt payments that show on your credit report

2. Divide the sum of your monthly debts by your monthly gross income (your take-home pay before taxes and other monthly deductions).
3. Convert the figure into a percentage and that is your DTI ratio.

Keep in mind that other monthly bills and financial obligations -- utilities, groceries, insurance premiums, healthcare expenses, daycare, etc. -- are not part of this calculation. 

example1:
Total annual income = 176000
monthly income = 176000 / 12 = 14666
monthly debts = 1363
debt to income ratio = 1363 / 14666 = 0.0929 
to figure out in percentage = 0.0929 * 100 = 9.29% 

example2:
For example, if your monthly debt equals $2,500 and your gross monthly income is $7,000, your DTI ratio is about 36 percent. (2,500/7,000=0.357).
  
# Debt to Income Ratio(DTI) Ranges

Looking good

(35% or less)

Relative to your income before taxes, your debt is at a manageable level. You most likely have money left over for saving or spending after you've paid your bills. Lenders generally view a lower DTI as favorable.
Opportunity to improve

(36% - 49%)

You're managing your debt adequately, but you may want to consider lowering your DTI. This could put you in a better position to handle unexpected expenses. If you're looking to borrow, keep in mind that lenders may ask for additional eligibility factors.
Take action

(50% or more)

With more than half your income before taxes going toward debt payments, you may not have much money left to save, spend, or handle unexpected expenses. With this DTI ratio, lenders may limit your borrowing options.

# Customer Default

To default is to fail to make a payment on a debt by the due date. If this happens with a credit card, creditors might raise interest rates to the default (or penalty rate) or decrease the line of credit. In case of serious delinquency, the card issuer can even take legal action to enforce payment or to garnish wages.


# How is credit to debt ratio calculated?

If you've only got one credit card and you've spent $400 out of a possible $2,000 this month, your debt-to-credit ratio is 20%.


# What is a good credit to debt ratio?
30%
FICOÂ® suggests that a good debt-to-credit ratio percentage is below 30%. And that goes for your ratio on any one of your cards separately as well as for your overall ratio.
